<h3>The simple application to read and generate QRcode with your own data</h3>

In main Page you will see general information about this application. And also list of all your image what you download and create before.

I use python library ```os``` in this project only for fun, to create an object and save to a db it is more easy way to manage you data in project.

for listed image in page and for delete this image I also use python library ```os``` and you already know what this meaning üòâ
To delete file I also use HTMX

<br><hr>


In page 'read_and_create' in one section you can choose image to read. Use HTMX attribute  ```hx-post``` send file to a back-end and with use python library ```opencv-python``` read the data from image(if data was coded in this image).

Response we put in section with id which we write in HTMX attribute  ```hx-target```

In section under you can write your data and convert it to an image. 

Using HTMX in this time again we send in a back-end our text and it this time I use library ```qrcode``` to generate QRimage.
And again Response we put in section with id which we write in HTMX attribute  ```hx-target```

Before diving let‚Äôs look at the things we are required to install in our system.

To run Django prefer to use the Virtual Environment

`pip install virtualenv`

Making and Activating the Virtual Environment:-

`virtualenv ‚Äúname as you like‚Äù`

`source env/bin/activate`

Installing Django:-

`pip install django`

Now, we need to clone project from Github:-
<p>Above the list of files, click Code.</p>
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-20363/images/help/repository/code-button.png">

Copy the URL for the repository.
<ul>
<li>To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", click</li>
<li>To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click</li>
<li>To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub CLI, then click</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33207/images/help/repository/https-url-clone-cli.png">

Open Terminal.

Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

`$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`

Press Enter to create your local clone.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...<br>
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

Install the project dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


create admin account (**remember you must be at the main application folder with file manage.py, and do this steps for
each application in this repository!!!!**)

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

then

`python manage.py makemigrations`

then again run

`python manage.py migrate`


to start the development server

`python manage.py runserver`

and open localhost:8000 on your browser to view the app.

Have fun
